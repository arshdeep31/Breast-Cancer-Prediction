# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
In this project, I developed a system that can help in diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage. I used a Random Forest classifier with selecting the top 10 features from the dataset containing 32 attributes using Gini score criteria and applying principal component analysis. We have achieved an accuracy of 96.49%, precision of 0.9756, recall of 0.9302.
