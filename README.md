# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Cancer is one of the most deadly diseases in the world. It has no proven cure. The only hope is to detect it at an early stage and undergo treatment. Today, machine learning is helping health workers diagnosing various deadly diseases.
We have developed a system that can help in diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage. We have used a Random Forest classifier with selecting the top 12 features from the dataset containing 32 attributes using Gini score criteria and applying principal component analysis. We have achieved an accuracy of 96.49%, precision of 0.9756, recall of 0.9302.
